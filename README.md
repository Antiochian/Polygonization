# Polygonization
Converting a collection of tiles into a polygonal mesh

This project is really just an excuse to practice my C++ class usage, as well as try out the "olcPixelGameEngine" by David Barr ([available here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)) as a tool to make easy visualisations of my stuff - I have been using PyGame for similar purposes in Python for a long time now, and I am very happy to say that this engine is just as hassle-free and useful - I foresee that I will be using a lot more in future.

As a bonus I am also learning the slightly arcane Visual Studio automatic git interface. More on the actual algorithm I wrote coming soon...
